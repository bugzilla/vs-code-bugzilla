# README

This is a bundle I use to work on bugzilla.
It includes support for additional syntaxes required by bugzilla:

* template toolkit
* apache config
* docker config
* YAML
* extended auto-closing-tags

It also adds support for code formatting (perltidy) and linting (perlcritic).

In the future it might include better syntax highlighting for perl as VSCode's is a little lacking for new features.
